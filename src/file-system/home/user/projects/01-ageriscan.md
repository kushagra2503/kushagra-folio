This was a project I built for a hackathon event with my team members, we built a device which can be used to monitor the temperature and soil moisture of the plant. We used the esp-32 microcontroller to build the device and we used the open-cv library to capture the image from the camera. We used the streamlit library to build the web app for the device. We used the temperature and soil moisture sensor to get the data and we used the ai to predict the plant disease and provide the solution. We won third position in the hackathon event.
