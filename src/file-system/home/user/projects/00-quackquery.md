QuackQuery is a Python based software package, which captures your screen in real time and users can ask question to ai based on the screen. I thought of this idea when I was exploring some of the ai tools available and everytime I had to upload the screenshot to ask a question, it was a pain. So, I thought of this idea to capture the screen in real time and ask question to ai based on the screen.

QuackQuery can be used and installed globally using pip.
pip install quackquery
