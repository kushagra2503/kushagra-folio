I participated in a pan India hackathon event conducted by the University of Madras, where the partipants were supposed to create a web scraper to scrape the data from their result website and store it in an excel sheet. I integrated Gemini API to the web scraper to make it more accurate and efficient. which answered the user's queries based on the generated excel sheet. I was conferred with the Second position in this event.
